### Cite µProteInS
µProteInS was published on Bioinformatics (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac115/6533442?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

Please consider citing our manuscript if the software was used during your analysis.

We have also published a chapter in Methods in Molecular Biology (Protein Informatics) describing the usage of this pipeline on publicly available data (https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-4007-4_2). If the tutorial was useful, please consider also citing it in your research:

We published another paper using µProteInS on Mycobacterium tuberculosis datasets, where we exemplify other possible downstream analyses after running the pipeline. It is also useful to understand how to make use of the different layers of validation provided by µProteInS:
